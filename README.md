# Power-BI-Project-Covid-19-Report
## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis and visualization of COVID-19 data using Power BI. The primary objective is to provide insights into the spread of the virus, its impact on various regions, and trends over time. The report is designed to help stakeholders understand the key patterns and make informed decisions based on the data.
## Data Preprocessing
Before the data was imported into Power BI, several preprocessing steps were undertaken to ensure data quality and consistency:
## Data Cleaning:
* Missing Values: Missing values were identified and handled. 
* Duplicates: Duplicate records were identified and removed to ensure that each data point was unique.
*  Calculated Fields: New fields such as Total deaths, Current active cases were created to provide more meaningful insights.
## Visualization using Power Bi:
The covid 19 data is analysed based on country and WHO region and Power BI is used as a visualization tool to create appropriate interactive graphs and charts to gain valuable insights and to better understand the data.
## Conclusion
* The actice cases and death rate were higher in US.
* The percentage of recovered ones are also higher in US.
* The death rate is lower in the western pacific region which include Malaysia, Japan , China , Australia etc..
